			<h3>An rpg Train driving game</h3>

			<h5>The train, chugging along the tracks.</h5>
			<p>
				A game where you drive a train around post-apocalyptic Eastern Europe and Russia. You are probably one of the last remnants of humanity. Before the war, you were a locomotive engineer for the Soviet Union, and typically traveled around. When the bombs fell, you wern't at home in Vladivostok, and when you returned, your family was gone, along with your home. 3 years after the bombs fell, you caught signal on a radio that in eastern Russia, there was a colony of survivers from all over. After 7 years of hard work, you finished repairing a 2-8-8-4 Steam Locomotive and set out on an expedition to find this colony, and hopefully, your family. Along the way you encounter many ruins of Soviet Blok facilities and empty villages. The only hostiles to the player will be the wildlife that have taken over.

			<h3>The train:</h3>

			<h5>An example view from a shunting train.</h5>
			<p>
				The train that the player drives is a single 2-8-8-4 Steam Locomotive, running on coal and other solid fuels, but can be upgraded to use liquid fuels. After the locomotive comes the tender, then a passenger carriage, and finally a TEM-2 Diesel Shunting Locomotive for those times when the player wants to add to their train, or to move something out of the way.

			<h3>Art Style:</h3>

			<p>
				To keep things from becoming to difficult from an artistic standpoint, the art style will be a simplified 3d design, similar to the art found in the Bravely series.
