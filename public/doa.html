			<h1>Depths of the Abyss</h1>
			<h2>An rpg game idea</h2>
			<p>
				A dungeon crawler rpg similar to DD:DA bitterblack isle. The player will explore a large dungeon, called the "Abyss". There are no sources of light other than the player's lantern, magic, and campfires. The creatures of the Abyss will be numerous and deadly, easily capable of killing the player regardless of stats. 
			</p>
			<h3>Art</h3>
			<p>
				The game will have a similar art style to the Bravely series of games, with characters having a stylized appearance in combo with a low polycount. Most areas of the game will be poorly lit, giving a very dark theme. This coupled with the bright and playful art style will help to 
			</p>
			<h4>Character Design</h4>
			<img src="img/cpt/bravely-2.png" width=100% title="Noah from the mobile game, Little Noah.">
			<p>
				Character design will follow the above style, mainly borrowing from the Bravely series and character style from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihiko_Yoshida"><em>Akihiko Yoshida</em></a>. Armor and clothing will have simple textures made primarily of solid colors with edge highlighting and ambient occlusion. All characters and enemies will have simple but distinct designs so that the player can distinguish between enemies based on silhouette and color scheme. 
			</p>
			<h4>Armor Design</h4>
			<p>
				Armors will encompass a wide range of styles and designs, mostly keeping towards the realistic end. The player should be able to tell right away how protective a piece of armor is based on visuals alone. Armor that doesn't look very protective probably wont be, and armor that looks lightweight probably is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Armor is broken up into head, torso, arms, legs, and back armor. Torso and leg armor is further broken into two slots: clothes and armor. The clothes slot is for shirts, jerkins, gambesons and other underclothes, and the armor slot is for the actual plates or leathers the player equips.
			</p>
			<h3>World</h3>
			<p>
				Set in a 1000 floor dungeon, 100 aboveground, and 900 below, this game gives the player a massive area to explore.
 				
 				<h4>100 aboveground floors</h4>
 	 			<li>1F-100F
 	 			<li>enemy levels increase by 10 per floor
 	 			<li>every 10th floor has a boss.
 				
 				<h4>900 underground floors</h4>
 	 			<li>B1F-B900F
 	 			<li>floor level starts at LV1000
 	 			<li>enemy levels increase by 50 per floor
 	 			<li>every 50th floor has a boss.
 				<li>below underground floors is infinite floors
 	 			<ul>
 	 				<li>randomly generated
 	 				<li>players are not expected to make it this far
 	 				<li>levels increase by 100 per floor
 	 			</ul>
 	 			
			</p>
			<h3>Player</h3>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<h3>Classes</h3>
			<p>
				There are 9 available classes for the player to choose from. Three main classes, three advanced classes, and three hybrid classes.
				<h4>Main:</h4>
				<li>Fighter
				<li>Stryder
				<li>Mage
				<h4>Advanced:</h4>
				<li>Warrior
				<li>Ranger
				<li>Sorcerer
				<h4>Hybrid:</h4>
				<li>Assassin

			</p>
			<p>
				The player can change classes at any campsite found within the dungeon. Each class has different strengths and weaknesses, as well as stat growth.
			</p>
			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<p>
				Gameplay will aim to be close to Dragons dogma, with the difficulty pushed higher towards dark souls.
