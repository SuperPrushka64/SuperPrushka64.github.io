			<h3>A top down 3d factory building game</h3>
			<img src="./img/satisfactorio/wp4344238.jpg" width=100%>
			<h5>Art from the game <em>Satisfactory.</em></h5>
			<p>
				In this game players will be dropped onto a handcrafted world within a region of their choice. Each region will promote different styles of play. The player can access any of the regions at any time, however, due to the size of the gameworld, doing so might be a large endeavour.
			</p>
			<h4>Tundra</h4>
			<p>
				This region will feature a large expansive flat region perfectly suitable to building your factory. Resources will be far from eachother (10-30km avg), and contain high purity. Such distances encourage the player to make use of trains to gather resources from far away mining areas. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Tundra features many lakes, small forests, as well as mud bogs and hills. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the recomended region for beginners as it will test their skills in all areas of the game. This region is also the largest of the 4 regions, and <thead></thead> first to be implemented.
			</p>
			<h4>Forest</h4>
			<p>
				The forest, much like the Tundra, has its resources fairly close toghether (1-2km avg) and with a lower purity average. Trees will need to be removed in order to construct your factory. 
			</p>
			<h4>Mountains</h4>
			<p>
				Mountains boast high resource purity, and extremely nearby resources (less than 1km average), however a difficult terrain problem is also presented. The mountains will test the player's ability to keep their factory organized and efficient given the limited space available.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mountain region is the hardest region to build in, but also the most rewarding in terms of resources.
			</p>
			<h4>Desert</h4>
			<p>
				The Desert region has moderate purity resources and a average distance between them (2-3km). Lack of water resources is something the player will have to account for when building their factory. Oil resources, however, are abundant throughout the region. 
			</p>
			<h3>Art Style:</h3>

			<h5>A train from the game <em>Satisfactorio.</em></h5>
			<p>
				The art style will follow these four main points:
				<li> Bright
				<li> Colorful
				<li> Bloom
				<li> Shallow depth of field.
			</p>
			<p>
