			<p>The challenging part of this assignment was getting the handlebars to work, and making the twits display their text when showing only one twit. I learned a lot about serverside code and handlebars from this assignment. For this assignment I used the lecture notes mostly, as those had everything needed.</p>

			<p>When doing this assignment, all was going well until I got to the portion where files are opened and sent to the client. This was mostly solved by making a dedicated function to load the files into a table. From this assignment, I learned quite abit about nodejs filesystem. The most useful resource was stack exchange, where I found posts of people that had similar problems to me, and I could adapt their soulutions to my own porposes. However, as I ended up rewriting most of the code, those posts became mostly useless when I figured out a better way of doing the file sending.</p>

			<p>The most difficult portion of this assignment was searching through the twits. At first I was using for loops to look through text from each element, however upon discovery of <em>.textContent</em> everything was made easy. I learned a lot about how js works and how to create new html elements with it. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"><em>W3Schools.com</em></a> was helpful for this assignment as well.</p>

			<p>Assignment 2 was a bit more difficult than the first assignment. The main problems I had was getting the links to be the appropriate colors, making the navbar look right, and bending the flexboxes to my will. I learned a lot about specificity as that was the issue with link colors. A helpful website I found was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"><em>W3Schools.com</em></a>, it is full of documentation for css, html, javascript, and is all around usefull for learning how certain elements work in a website.</p>

			<p>This assignment was quite easy. I even added a page for dogs. The whole assignemnt only took about 15 or so minutes as I had followed along with the lecture on html, then removed unnessicary things. I learned quite a bit about web development and hope to learn more so I can make a horrible 90s style page for fun (I'm talking particle effects, sounds, crappy animations, the whole 9 yards).</p>
