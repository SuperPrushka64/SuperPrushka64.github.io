    	<h1>KSP: Exodus Program</h1>
    	<p>The Exodus Program's primary goals are to explore the Kerbol locality, as well as the Cercani star system. Each of these entries are broken up into three parts: 
    		<ul>
    			<li>Research and Development news
    			<li>Planned and ongoing mission news
    			<li>Flight Research Division news.
    		</ul>
    	</p>
    	<h3>Progress towards Cercani:</h3>

    	<p>The Type 14 P4Z Narehate is a versatile craft capable of long term expeditions outside of Kerbin SOI. Complete with a BOP-90 Warp O' Tron Miniturized Warp Core, allowing for extra-solar expeditions. Included is twin Kerbin Electric Inc. Molten salt fission reactors used to power the ship's Ix-8212 ION-CROSS main thrusters. The simple design also includes a small rover with basic science equipment for gathering those sweet reports. Despite it's space shuttle like appearance, it is <em>not</em> capable of atmospheric flight.</p>
    	<img src="img/s40.jpg" title="The new lander system in LMO." alt="A picture of the new lander system in LMO." width=100%>
    	<p>A new landing system has also been developed for the planned Vassa missions, however, probe tests have indicated that the atmosphere is much thinner than anticipated, rendering parachutes relatively useless and adding a higher fuel requirement for the landers. More testing is required. Full powered landing on Mun will be conducted to test potential upgrades to the lander series.</p>
    	<img src="img/s6.jpg" title="A new airframe" alt="A picture of the new airframe in LMO." width=100%>
    	<p>The Flight Research Division has developed a new SSTO spacecraft. Originally a new long range survey plane, a bold pilot who shall not be named, decided it would be a grand idea to find out how fast the craft could go. Upon finding that the max speed was somewhere in the neighborhood of mach <strong><em>6</em></strong>, the Flight Research Division decided to slightly modify the airframe for spaceflight, resulting in a fine SSTO spaceplane</p>
